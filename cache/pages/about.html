My research focus is the within species evolution of highly repeated DNA sequence, both TEs and satellite DNA. The real joy of this is that the tools and approaches that work well for single-copy sequence donâ€™t work so well for repetitive sequences, so I get spend a lot of time thinking about the sorts of strategies and ways of thinking could reveal the biologically meaningful patterns in the data. But the </p>
<p>I do most of my coding in Python and only relearn C++ about once every two years when I absolutely need it. </p>
