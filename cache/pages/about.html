<p>My name is Michael McGurk. I'm a PhD candidate in Dan Barbash's lab at Cornell University, studying the evolution of repetitive DNA using population genomic data. I like to dig into things. Start with a question or observation, and just dig. Ask &quot;Why?&quot;, &quot;How should I think about this?&quot; &quot;What does is it mean?&quot; Ask &quot;Why?&quot; again. Biology is really rich in substrate for this curiosity and genomics with its enormous datasets provides an ample sandbox for digging.</p>
<p>Doing it with computers just doubles the opportunities for fun. I get to spend a lot of time thinking about the sorts of strategies and ways of thinking could reveal the biologically meaningful patterns in the data. But I also get think about spheres in Hamming spaces and how accomplish a task with the fewest number of operations or even use Spotify to mask repeats.</p>
<p>I'm regularly surprised by where solutions turn up, and it keeps the research exciting.</p>
