I'm a PhD candidate in Daniel Barbash's lab at Cornell University. My research focus is the within species evolution of highly repeated DNA sequence, both TEs and satellite DNA. The real joy of this is that the tools and approaches that work well for single-copy sequence don't work so well for repetitive sequences, and so thtrying to determine what strategies and ways of thinking could reveal the biologically meaningful patterns in the data. But the I do most of my coding and development in Python and only relearn C++ about once every two years when I absolutely need it.","tags":"Blogs","loc":"https://laptopbiologist.github.io/pages/about.html","title":"About"},{"url":"https://laptopbiologist.github.io/pages/publications.html","text":"Michael Peter McGurk, and Daniel A Barbash. 2018.

Transposable elements are genetic parasites which can make copies of themselves at new locations dispersed throughout a genome. They are ubiquitious and can comprise large proportions of eukaryotic genomes, often outnumbering functional genes. Satellite DNA, on the other hand, are regions of the genome where the same sequence is repeated over and over again in tandem, for thousands or millions of basepairs. Satellites are not implicitly mobile and tend to be found in subtelomeric and pericentric sequence. While these two classes of sequence appear disparate at first glance, there are both technical and biological factors that unify their study. First, repetitive sequence is challenging to analyze with the most common types of sequencing data (Illumina short-reads) using standard tools. A consequence is that we understand far less about the evolution and impacts of TE and satellite variation than we do for single-copy sequence. So, any tool that could circumvent the general challenges of interpreting repeat-derived sequencing reads would provide insights into both classes of sequence. The first task of my dissertation research was to develop a general tool for leveraging population genomic dataset to study repeats, ConTExt , which ultimately made it possible to ask a variety of questions about both satellites and TEs. From the biological angle, both classes of sequence are major components of constitutive heterochromatin, regions of the genome that are transcriptionally and recombinationally repressed. Much of this sequence is certainly nonfunctional junk DNA, but there is clear evidence that variation in heterochromatin can underlie reproductive barriers between related species, disrupt normal chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis, and alter gene expression locally and possibly globally (presumably by titrating chromatin binding factors). Further, some surprising connections between TEs and satellite DNA have come out of this project. Most strikingly, the fundamental characteristic of TEs--transposition-- regularly generates substrate from which new satellite arrays can emerge.","tags":"Blogs","loc":"https://laptopbiologist.github.io/pages/research.html","title":"Research"},{"url":"https://laptopbiologist.github.io/why-and-how-i-set-up-this-site-part-1.html","text":"I've wanted to set up a research blog for a while now. Over the course of any project you stumble across tricks and tools that you can't really emphasize in publications (due to space or focus considerations), but which would be probably helpful to other researchers. Sure, they end up in the (supplemental) methods, but no one is going to find them. And frankly, the solutions to many of the stumbling blocks I've stumbled upon or the \" Eureka! \"-shouting resolution to tricky concepts are found, not in publications, but in the helpful blog posts other researchers took the time to write and publish. Thanks to the internet, the way we disseminate information as researchers has moved beyond conferences and publications (certainly not an original conclusion), and I want to make an active effort to pay forward some of those private eurekas . But I'm a biologist not a computer scientist by training. I think the last time I tried setting anything up resembling a blog was when I made a MySpace page for my cat back in high school (draw for yourself whatever conclusions arise naturally from that admission). So creating a science blog required a bit of planning and consideration. There were several things I knew I wanted. First, I didn't want to pay for anything. Second, however I set up this blog, I wanted the option of directly generating it from my research notes. The reason is I want to lower the activation energy necessary to communicate an idea (I believe accounting for future laziness is key to productivity). These days, my notes are almost exclusively found in Jupyter notebooks, and I've increasingly relied on Colaboratory (which is basically Google Docs, but for Jupyter notebooks). So a format that can be painlessly generated from Jupyter notebooks was a must. Another consideration is where should I host this blog. Googling around for options answered two questions at once \"How do I do this?\" and \"Where do I host the blog?\" with Github Pages . As it turns out, GitHub--where I store and version control most of my code--allows users to host (for free) static web pages in a repository titled username.github.io. The restriction that they be static meant that the \"How?\" probably ought to be something that can generate static web pages. It looked like there were several appealling options, with Jekyll and Pelican being the most commonly recommended. I played with Jekyll and bit a really liked (for great ), but all of the guides for converting Jupyter notebooks to web pages seemed like the process was clunky. So I went with Pelican (which is apparently an anagram of the French for 'notebook': calepin) Now static I had t downgrade html5lib using pip install --upgrade html5lib==1.0b8","tags":"blogging","loc":"https://laptopbiologist.github.io/why-and-how-i-set-up-this-site-part-1.html","title":"Why and how I set up this site - Part 1"}]}
