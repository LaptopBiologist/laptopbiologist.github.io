.. description: About me

My name is Michael McGurk. I'm a PhD candidate in Dan Barbash's lab at Cornell University, studying the evolution of repetitive DNA using population genomic data. I have a deep need to dig into things. I like to start with a question or observation, and just dig. The types of question I really enjoy are "Why?", "How should I think about this?" and "Why?" again. Biology is really rich in opportunities for these types of questions, and genomics with its enormous datasets provides an ample sandbox for digging. 

Doing it with computers just doubles the opportunities for fun. I get spend a lot of time thinking about the sorts of strategies and ways of thinking could reveal the biologically meaningful patterns in the data. But I also get think about spheres in Hamming spaces and how accomplish a task with the fewest number of operations or even use Spotify to mask repeats. 

I'm regularly surprised by where solutions turn up, and it keeps the research exciting.
